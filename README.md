# MNIST_Classification_From_Scratch-
MNIST image classification using only numpy and pandas

LIBRARIES USED:

Numpy

Pandas

Matplotlib

DESCRIPTION:

This project trains a neural network to classify Handwritten numbers MNIST dataset using two methods (Iterative and Vectorized). The model contains two hidden layers with sigmoid activation.
